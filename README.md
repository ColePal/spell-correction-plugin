# spell-correction-plugin
Project: Implement a user interface for a spell correction system, and a web plugin  
Supervisor: Dr Surangika Ranathunga (s.ranathunga@massey.ac.nz)  
Project Overview: 
In this project, a web interface and a web plugin should be implemented for a spell corrector 
system. The spell corrector back-end has already been implemented using Large Language 
Models (LLMs). In this project, the students need to figure out how to connect that LLM to a web
based system. When a user enters the text to be corrected, the corrected version should appear 
in a secondary text box. Changed words should be highlighted. When the web plugin is enabled, 
text entered to a textbox should be highlighted when there are spelling errors. When the user 
clicks on a highlighted word, possible spellings should be suggested (this is similar to how we fix 
spelling errors in a document). Students also need to keep stats of the common errors made by 
users and create a visualization dashboard. The interface should have language localization 
support. 
Hosting LLMs MAY cost money. A student will have to spend about NZD 20 for the entire project, 
but they can always look for free alternatives.
